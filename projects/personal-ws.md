### Development Process
At the Start of 2023 I wanted to create a personal website much like the current one you are on. To showcase my experience and projects I am working on. Because I had no experience in web development I wanted to make it a learning process as well. This is why I used vanilla Javascript because I wanted to learn the basics first before getting introducted to managed packages and Javascript add ons. Using only a few hundred lines of code I was able to build a simple site in HTML, CSS, and JS. The site is live at <a href="https://connorn.dev">connorn.dev</a> .

### Result
Once completed I was happy with the result. However as you can see it is very simple and doesn't showcase all of my ability now. This is why I would like to redo the site at the end of this year using React.
