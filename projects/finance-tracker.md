After trying many different finance tracking methods such as Intuit Mint, YNAB, Rocket Money, Notion, and writing it out on paper every month I realized most are either time consuming to use and track finances, or offer no flexability. I found Excel/Google Sheets to be the best in terms of flexibility, however entering every tranaction manually is time consuming and annoying. Because of this I decided to create a tool to automatically sync your bank transactions and balances into Google Sheets. This way you have all the data Fiannce tracking apps such as Mint have access to, but you can customize your Google sheet to include or exclude data in a format that works for you. Below

<pre>
You open your eyes, and you are greeted by an unfamiliar ceiling.
Startled, you get to your feet and quickly scan your surroundings. It's
dark except for the stream of light coming from a crack on the only boarded
window in the room. You try to peek through the crack, but you cannot see
anything. You wonder where you are and who could have possibly brought you here.

look
The room is a picture of decay with only a faded number identifying it as room-4. The bed you were
 lying on is stained with what looks like dried blood. Could it be your blood? No - it is not. The
 only way out of the room aside from the door to the corridor is a window that is boarded shut. It
 looks like it has been like that for decades. There is a door going west from here. You see a candle
 on the floor. You see a match on the floor.

The candle is now lit. It illuminates everything in the room.

walk west
The corridor is lit with the candle. It is so long that you cannot see to the end. You notice that
 there are words written on the wall. There is a door going east from here. There is a way going north
 from here. There is a door going south from here.
