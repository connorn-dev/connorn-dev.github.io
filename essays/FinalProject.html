<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The Problem: Many UH students and students in general have a hard time keeping track and control of their finances. This is during a time when spending and savings habits are being built and instilled into students and will affect their future habits. With many finance tracking apps currently on the market, there remains few that tailer their experience towards students and allow data specific to only studnets. Such as scholoarships, help from parents, or data relating to student meal plans.</p>

<h3 id="the-solution">The Solution</h3>
<p>The solution to this problem is a web app finace tracker that allows for important data students want compiled together to help them better understand where they are and where they are going. The web app must include the students income, outside help they recive, scholarships. Comparing it against their expenses. Allow students to fianacially plan for upcoming</p>

<h3 id="the-case-against-standardization">The Case Against Standardization</h3>
<p>When projects are small or only require a developer or two, it doesn’t always make sense to create standardization and then try to adhere to it strictly. It can frustrate developers with another learning curve, rigid constraints, and subjectivity against other developers on standards. Because of this, I don’t believe it makes sense to create new standards when developers are working alone or on minimal projects. However, best practices should still be practiced and maybe a coding standard that has always been created can be implemented. As projects grow with more developers and code, custom standards can be created and added to fit the project better with the specific needs of the project.</p>

<h3 id="standardize-this">Standardize This</h3>
<p>While coding standardizations create strict rules, for what to do and when to do it the same is not for when to implement standardization. It is up to the team to decide on an appropriate point in projects to start implementing standardization. However as stated before, it is best practice to keep a level of consistency among developers and to follow a simple company-wide standardization. When projects grow, the idea of new standardizations can be brought up. It is up to each induvidual developer and team to decide when this happens.</p>
